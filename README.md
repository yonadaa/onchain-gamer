# Sidekick

An AI assistant for playing onchain games.

Sidekick is fully autonomous - give it a contract address and goal, and it will continuously reason and send transactions without further intervention.
It runs in the browser, so you can stop and start it at will, generate individual moves, or just control the player yourself.
