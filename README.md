# Onchain Gamer

Your AI agent for playing onchain games:

- Fully autonomous. Give Gamer a goal in natural language, and it will continuously reason and send transactions without any further intervention.
- Precise control. Gamer runs in the game client, so you can stop and start it at will, generate individual transactions, or just control the player yourself.
- Minimal setup. Simply provide a contract's source code and storage - the agent figures out how to accomplish your goal.
